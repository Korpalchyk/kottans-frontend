# First steps to frontend / backbegin, or how to improve your sence of humor:
Hi, everyone. So, I've passed through "git basis". To be honest - I was total noob in it, did not know whats repo, commit etc is.
Never the less - seems to be ok, passed, not perfect, but doing my best.

With some literature got some knowledge what this thing is all about, but need practice also with real projects.![git_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110791053/193671055-ace1d0f9-b298-41b6-906d-bf64fbc77ded.PNG)

So, what's next...
